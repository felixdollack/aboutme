abstract = {In the context of mobility as a Service (MaaS), bicycles are an important mode of transport for the first and last mile between the home and other transport modalities. Also, due to covid-19 bicycle users such as food delivery drivers and commuters to work are increasing. To investigate driving experience of bicycle users in context and improve MaaS service quality, we propose and describe a method to automatically detect changes in user emotions during bicycle riding by sampling facial images using a smartphone. We describe the proposed method and how we plan to use it in the future.},
