We proposed a shooting game based on whole body motion. This game need 2 vs 2 players, and each team control one spaceship. the movement of one player corresponds to the spaceship movement in X direction, and the movement of another player corresponds to the movement in Y direction. This game is projected on floor and players move along the sides of projected screen. All player can shoot with jumping motion and make a shield with squat motion.

This system make players active as much as possible, and we want to motivate obesity children  to move their body who love to play game.

This project is ongoing.
