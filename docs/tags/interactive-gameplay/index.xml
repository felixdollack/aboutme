      <description>&lt;p&gt;We proposed a shooting game based on whole body motion. This game need 2 vs 2 players, and each team control one spaceship. the movement of one player corresponds to the spaceship movement in X direction, and the movement of another player corresponds to the movement in Y direction. This game is projected on floor and players move along the sides of projected screen. All player can shoot with jumping motion and make a shield with squat motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system make players active as much as possible, and we want to motivate obesity children  to move their body who love to play game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
