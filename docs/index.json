Participants were asked to estimate egocentric distance to the sound source in two conditions: auditory with GUI (A), auditory with HMD (A+V). We found that a systematical offset is introduced by the visual stimulus.","tags":["acoustic perception","psychoacoustics","VR"],"title":"On the Analysis of Acoustic Distance Perception in a Head Mounted Display","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.
